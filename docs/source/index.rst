bin_placing documentation
=====================
Bin placing is a python3 library for generating 2d simulations of bin packing
and placement operations. It uses shapely, numpy, and matplotlib to create
an environment for placing 2d objects into a 2d bin. It is intended for use in
reinforcement learning applications for automated bin packing, and can be used
for computational geometry applications.

To run, first create a virtual environment using the requirements from requirements.txt.
Then, source your virtual environment and run
```
python3 rollout_mdp.py
```
from the root directory. This should spin up a matplotlib plot with a square bin.
